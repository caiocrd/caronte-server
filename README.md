# React Showcase Server
A Heroku App for the mocked REST API used in the online version of the [React Showcase](https://github.com/joserogeriofilho/react-showcase) project.

This project is based on the [@jesperorb](https://github.com/jesperorb) instructions, please check it out: [**Deploy json-server to {{ free hosting site }}**](https://github.com/jesperorb/json-server-heroku)

## Live Demo
If in a first attempt the application fails to load showing an **application error page**, please try refreshing the browser since the Heroku plataform put applications to sleep after some time of inactivity. The second request should work wihtout any problem.
